terrarium is an IRC server with a focus on being small and understandable,
originally forked from [horgh/catbox](https://github.com/horgh/catbox). The
goal is to create an easy-to-configure I2P IRC server which is highly stable
and secure, while retaining the ability to link with non-I2P IRC servers using
TLS in order to bridge anonymous and non-anonymous chat.
